### Data Models

```typescript
interface Layer {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    type: LayerType;
    visible: boolean;
    locked: boolean;
    opacity: number;
    elements: Element[];
}

interface Element {
    id: string;
    type: ElementType;
    geometry: Geometry;
    properties: Properties;
    style: Style;
}

interface Plant {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    scientificName: string;
    mature: {
        height: number;
        spread: number;
    };
    growingConditions: GrowingConditions;
    maintenance: MaintenanceRequirements;
    seasons: SeasonalFeatures;
}

interface Area {
    id: string;
    type: AreaType;
    geometry: Geometry;
    calculations: {
        area: number;
        perimeter: number;
        volume?: number;
    };
    materials: MaterialRequirements;
}
```
