# Landscape CAD Project Plan

## Overview
A professional-grade CAD system specifically designed for garden and landscape planning, allowing users to create detailed outdoor space designs with multiple layers and accurate measurements.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation
- Basic layer system
- Essential drawing tools
- Simple area calculations
- Project saving/loading

## Phase 2: Paper Size Implementation
1. Add paper size selector with standard formats:
   - A5 (148 × 210 mm) / US Half Letter (5.5 × 8.5 in)
   - A4 (210 × 297 mm) / US Letter (8.5 × 11 in)
   - A3 (297 × 420 mm) / US Tabloid (11 × 17 in)
   - A2 (420 × 594 mm) / US C size (17 × 22 in)
   - A1 (594 × 841 mm) / US D size (22 × 34 in)

2. Implement canvas scaling:
   - Dynamic grid adjustment based on paper size
   - Maintain metric/imperial unit conversion
   - Zoom controls for detailed work

3. Add print preparation:
   - Page margins and safe zones
   - Print preview functionality
   - Export to PDF with correct dimensions

## Phase 3: Plant Management
- Plant database integration
- Plant placement tools
- Basic growth visualization
- Plant lists and documentation

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Complex calculations
- Material estimation
- Cost analysis
- Advanced visualization
- Season changes

## Phase 5: Drawing Enhancements
1. Add measurement annotations:
   - Automatic dimension lines
   - Area labels with calculations
   - Scale indicator

2. Implement advanced snapping:
   - Endpoint snapping
   - Midpoint snapping
   - Perpendicular/parallel guides

3. Add shape libraries:
   - Common garden elements
   - Standard plant symbols
   - Hardscape patterns

## Phase 6: Project Management
1. Add project metadata:
   - Client information
   - Project scale
   - North arrow and orientation

2. Implement layer organization:
   - Layer groups
   - Layer templates
   - Custom layer colors

3. Add collaboration features:
   - Export/import layer sets
   - Share project templates
   - Element libraries

## Implementation Timeline
- Each phase is designed to be completed in 2-3 weeks
- Features will be released incrementally
- Total project timeline: 12-18 weeks

   - Secure login system
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypted storage
   - Secure file handling
   - Regular backups
   - GDPR compliance

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - API key management
